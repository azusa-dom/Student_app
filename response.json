Throughout your degree, you’ll apply theoretical knowledge to practical activities such as workshops, demonstrations and visits, working with your peers to solve real and challenging problems. In your second year, you’ll have the option to apply for an additional year in industry. If your application is approved, you’ll transfer to the four-year Computer Science (Year in Industry) BSc. This means you’ll pause your academic studies after your second year, to spend your third year working on placement with one of our approved industrial partners. During this year, you’ll gain practical experience, applying your computing knowledge and skills in a professional environment. After completing your Year in Industry, you’ll return to UCL to resume your studies and complete your degree in your final year. Students can typically expect to have 25 contact hours per week during teaching term time. Contact hours may vary depending on the year of study, module selection, and timetable. You will be able to review each module’s indicative timetable in advance of making and confirming your module selections for each year. In addition to contact hours, students are expected to dedicate approximately 15 hours per week to independent study. This may involve preparing for classes, completing assignments, and engaging in required reading or practical activities. Your progress will be assessed through a broad range of methods, which typically include individual and group coursework, lab demonstrations and reports, individual and group projects, tests and written examinations, and oral assessments. In your final year, you’ll produce a substantive project or dissertation. Assessment methods used may vary, depending on the optional and elective modules you choose.

Our degree offers a truly global, de-centred and yet historically grounded curriculum, enabling students to flourish as independent and critical thinkers, capable of tackling urgent global challenges. The three-year degree offers a strong grounding in sociological theory and research methods, with a focus on how sociology can be applied to important contemporary issues. Our degree emphasises the strong inter-linkages between the local and the global, while giving you the ability to engage with and undertake qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods research. Completing a work-based project and a dissertation enables you to enhance your future employment prospects and tailor your study to your own areas of interest. You will benefit from a research-led curriculum delivered by world-leading sociologists in the Social Research Institute (SRI) and you will study at IOE, UCL’s Faculty of Education and Society, ranked No.1 in the world for Education for the past 11 years (QS World University Rankings by Subject, 2024). There is also an opportunity to study abroad for a year (meaning you will complete four years of study in total) at one of our partner institutions. What this course will give you The degree will help you develop your sociological identity and make you an asset to 21st-century employers as they navigate an evolving socio-economic landscape. Throughout your studies, you will gain a strong foundation in essential sociological theories and develop advanced analytical and methodological skills, from ethnography to quantitative techniques. You will also receive training in key analytical tools such as SPSS for statistical analysis. Practical experience is integrated into the programme through our Work-Based Module, where you will engage with organisations in social policy, local government, community engagement, and research. Additionally, you may contribute to academic research in SRI via the Internship Module (subject to availability). These combined skills, training, and experiences will prepare you for a range of career paths. To support your career development, you will participate in tailored workshops led by SRI and gain access to UCL’s wider career networks and events. Finally, studying and living in London provides a unique opportunity to engage with grassroots and third-sector organisations, councils, and businesses through guest lectures and site visits—enhancing your skills, knowledge, and professional network for both career progression and active citizenship."},{"heading":"Teaching and learning","text":"In each year of your degree you will take a number of individual modules, normally valued at 15 or 30 credits, adding up to a total of 120 credits for the year.
